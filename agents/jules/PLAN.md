CI Governance: SHA Pinning Enforcement

Jules enforces full SHA pinning across all workflows using:

- GitHub Actions policy enforcement (Settings > Actions > Require SHA pinning)
- CI validator workflow (validate-sha.yml) using action-sha-pinned-actions
- Dependabot for weekly SHA updates
- Immutable release pinning for trusted actions

All agents must inherit this policy. Violations trigger CI failure.
